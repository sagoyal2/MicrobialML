## Application of Machine Learning to Predict Microbial Gram Stain and Respiration based on Annotated Biological Functions

Due to the recent advancements in genome sequencing technologies, there are hundreds of microbes being sequenced daily. It is vital to interpret the high throughput sequencing data quickly and profile these organisms in various domains as to their respiration type, antimicrobial resistance, variations in cell wall etc. as it may aid many medical and research applications. Here we use four machine learning algorithms K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Naive Gaussian Bayes Classifier (black-box algorithms) and Decision Tree Classifier (white-box algorithm) in determining bacterial phenotypes of respiration and Gram stain types. We have identified that while all four of the classifier algorithms performed reasonably well in identifying the phenotypes of Gram stain and respiration, the optimized version of Decision Tree Classifier performed significantly better. We compare and contrast the predictions in our analysis and the biological significance of the predicted outcomes.
